Airline Information:

One or more of your flights is listed as being "operated" by another carrier. In these cases, it is even more important to verify your check in location.

When multiple airlines are included on a single ticket, the value of the ticket is held on what the airlines describe as the "ticketing carrier". Your ticket value is held by US Airways.

We recommend that you arrive at the airport a minimum of 90 minutes in advance of departure for domestic flights, and at least 2 hours in advance of departure for international flights. If you choose not to take your outbound flight, the airlines will automatically cancel the remainder of your reservation and no refunds will be granted for the unused portion of your trip.
